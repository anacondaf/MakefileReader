## [1.1.0] - 2024-12-19

### üéØ Major Features Added

#### Smart Argument Support System
- **Variable Detection Engine**: Automatically detects `$(VARIABLE)` and `${VARIABLE}` references in Makefile commands
- **Argument Input Dialog**: Beautiful Dracula-themed dialog for entering variable values
- **Default Value Pre-population**: Automatically loads default values from Makefile definitions (`VAR ?= default`)
- **Live Command Preview**: Shows the exact command that will be executed as you type
- **Visual Indicators**: ‚öôÔ∏è gear icons next to targets that require arguments

#### Enhanced UI Components
- **Dynamic Button Text**: "Execute" vs "Execute ‚öôÔ∏è" based on argument requirements
- **Tooltip Support**: "Requires arguments" tooltips for better user guidance
- **BooleanToVisibilityConverter**: Proper XAML converter for conditional UI element display
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full Enter/Escape support in argument dialog

#### Advanced Makefile Parsing
- **Pre-expansion Variable Detection**: Detects variables before they are expanded with default values
- **Smart Command Processing**: Maintains original command structure for accurate variable extraction
- **Default Value Parsing**: Reads and utilizes `VARIABLE ?= default` definitions from Makefiles

### üêõ Critical Bug Fixes

#### Parser Engine Fixes
- **Variable Detection Bug**: Fixed issue where variables were expanded to default values before detection, causing `HasVariables = false` for targets that actually required arguments
- **Command Expansion Order**: Reordered parsing to detect variables first, then expand commands
- **Target Classification**: Corrected logic to properly identify which targets need user input

#### UI Rendering Fixes
- **Color.FromRgb Error**: Fixed missing green/blue parameters in RGB color definitions

## Development Notes

### Version 1.1.0 Highlights
This release represents a major advancement in Makefile integration within Visual Studio. The addition of smart argument support transforms the extension from a simple execution tool into a comprehensive Makefile management solution. The variable detection system ensures that users are never surprised by missing arguments, while the intuitive dialog system makes complex Makefile operations accessible to developers of all skill levels.

### Architecture Evolution
The parsing engine has been significantly enhanced to handle the complexities of variable detection and expansion. The decision to detect variables before expansion was crucial for maintaining the semantic meaning of Makefile commands while still providing users with the flexibility to override default values.

### User Experience Focus
Every UI enhancement in this release was driven by user feedback and real-world usage scenarios. The Dracula theme provides a modern, professional appearance that integrates seamlessly with popular development environments, while the visual indicators and tooltips ensure that functionality is discoverable and intuitive.

### Performance Considerations
Despite the added complexity of variable detection and dialog management, performance has been maintained through careful optimization of parsing algorithms and efficient UI data binding. The extension remains responsive even with large, complex Makefiles.
